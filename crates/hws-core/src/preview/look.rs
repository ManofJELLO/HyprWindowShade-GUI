//! What the preview should look like, taken from the running compositor.
//!
//! The preview is only worth looking at if the window in it resembles the
//! user's own windows: a shader that tints a corner reads differently against
//! 0px rounding than against 16px, and an open animation is the shader and the
//! compositor's own motion together.
//!
//! Rather than parse the user's config — which may be Lua, may be `.conf`, and
//! is none of this app's business — the look is asked of the running instance
//! with `hyprctl`. That works whatever the config is written in, and it
//! reflects anything changed at runtime too. With Hyprland not running there is
//! nothing to preview in the first place, so the defaults here are only a
//! fallback for options that cannot be read.
